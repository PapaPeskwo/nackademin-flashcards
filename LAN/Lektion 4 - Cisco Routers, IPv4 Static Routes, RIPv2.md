What does DHCP stand for?;; Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What protocol does all routers use?;; RIP
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
If you don't want to use DHCP, what else can you do to obtain an IP address?;; Set a static IP address 
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
How does a device know where to send an IP address request?;; The requesting device's MAC address is used to identify where the IP address should be sent.
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What is the communication method used by ARP for its requests and responses?;; In ARP, the request is always sent as a broadcast, meaning it reaches all devices on the network. In contrast, the response is always sent as a unicast, which means it is directed specifically to the requesting device.
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What does ARP stand for?;; Address Resolution Protocol

What are the two primary methods used by routers for making routing decisions in a network?
?
1. Distance Vector routing 
2. Cost-based routing
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->

What does EIGRP stand for?;; Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What does OSPF stand for?;; Open Shortest Path First
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What does IS-IS stand for?;; Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System
What does RIP stand for?;; Routing Information Protocol
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
Which routing protocol relies on 'hop counts' as its metric to determine the best path for data packet transmission in a network?;; Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
<!--SR:!2023-05-02,4,270-->
What are the two main functions of the Internet Protocol (IP)?;; Addressing and fragmenting data
Name a distance-vector routing protocol;; RIP

Name a cost-based routing protocol;; OSPF
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What is the typical communication method used by routing protocols?;; Multicast
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What is the typical communication method used by switching protocols?;; Broadcast
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What does VLSM stand for?;; Variable Length Subnet Mask
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What does CIDR stand for?;; Classless Inter Domain Routing
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What is the purpose of a router?;; The router is responsible for the routing of traffic between networks
Are routers computers?;; True
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What is the purpose of routing tables?;; To determine the best path to send packets
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What is the purpose of a subnet mask?;; It identifies the host's netowork subnet
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
What CLI command do you use to activate LAN and WAN interfaces?;; `no shutdown`
In which protocol is the loopback interface an important aspect of?;; OSPF
<!--SR:!2023-04-29,1,230-->
