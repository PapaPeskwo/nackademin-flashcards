What is a default gateway?
?
A default gateway makes it possible for devices in one network to communicate with devices in another network. If a computer, for example, requests a web page, the request goes through the default gateway before exiting the local network (LAN) to reach the internet.
Think of a default gateway as an intermediate device between the local network and the internet. The default gateway transfers internal data to the internet and back again.
